# Hypha Collab Board

:link: [`hyphacoop-collab-board.herokuapp.com`][app]

The purpose of this small app is to help us understand our alignment
during meetings, even when we can't see one another's faces or read body
language. It's designed to be easy to use continuously on mobile phone, without
consuming visual attention.
